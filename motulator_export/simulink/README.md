# Simulink export

Export of *motulator* systems to Simulink, corresponding to the PLECS export.
The control system runs the same C code as in the PLECS model: the code sections of the C-Script block (the C port of the *motulator* control algorithms in `../c`) are wrapped in a generated C MEX S-function, in a masked subsystem whose parameters follow the *motulator* API.
The system model is built from basic Simulink blocks, so no toolboxes are needed.

## Usage

```bash
python examples/ipmsm_2kw_fvc_simulink.py
```

This writes the MATLAB script `examples/simulink/build_ipmsm_2kw_fvc.m` and the source of the S-function (`sfun_flux_vector_control.c`) in the same folder.
Running the script in MATLAB compiles the S-function (`mex`) and saves `ipmsm_2kw_fvc.slx`.
If the MATLAB Engine API for Python matching the MATLAB release (e.g., `pip install matlabengine==26.1.*` for R2026a) is installed, the Python script also builds and simulates the model and prints the maximum differences from *motulator*, as the PLECS comparison scripts do.

The C port uses the C99 complex type (`complex.h`), so `mex` must use gcc (Linux), clang (macOS), or MinGW-w64 (Windows, the MATLAB Support for MinGW-w64 C/C++ Compiler add-on, selected with `mex -setup C`); MSVC does not support it.
A compiled S-function stays loaded in MATLAB after its model is closed, so run `clear mex` before rebuilding a model that was open in MATLAB.

## S-function

The S-function defines the C-Script macros used in the code (`InputSignal`, `OutputSignal`, `ParamRealData`, `ParamDim`, `SetErrorMessage`, `ContState`, and `ContDeriv`) with the Simulink API and calls the code sections in its callbacks: the start function in `mdlStart`, the output function in `mdlOutputs`, and the update function in `mdlUpdate`.
It has the ports, the parameters, the sample time, and the continuous states of the C-Script block.
As in *motulator*, the outputs are computed from the measurements of the same sampling instant and the states are updated in `mdlUpdate`.
The state of the C code is in static variables, as in the C-Script block, so a model can contain one instance of the block.

The first input of every control system is `enable` (see `enable_code` in `../plecs/_common.py`), which is 1 in the exported models by default (`enable` of `write_model`).
While it is not positive, the control algorithm is not run: the duty ratios are 0.5, the monitored signals are zero, and the state is reset to its initial value (a copy saved at the end of the start function).
The control system thus starts from its initial state when enabled, e.g., after a fault.
The control systems limit the measured DC-bus voltage to at least 1 V (`U_DC_MIN`), which avoids the division by zero in the PWM if the DC bus is not charged.
The simulated control system is thus the same as the one run in a real-time target.

## Control system for real-time targets

The control system of an induction machine drive can be exported alone as a library, to be used with the I/O blocks of a real-time target (e.g., dSPACE) instead of the system model:

```bash
python examples/im_2kw_cvc_control.py
```

This writes `examples/simulink/build_im_2kw_cvc_control.m` (`im.write_control_system`), which builds the library `im_2kw_cvc_control.slx` containing the masked subsystem of the control system, with the inputs `enable`, `w_M_ref`, `i_s_abc`, `u_dc`, and `w_M` and the outputs `d_abc` and `signals`.
The code of the S-function is that of the model `im_2kw_cvc.slx`, but its source (`sfun_im_2kw_cvc_control.c`, named after the library) is standalone, i.e., it contains the C port, so the folder has all the files needed for building the real-time application.
The library is saved in the format of the MATLAB release that runs the script, so run the script in the release of the target.

The computational delay of one sampling period and the PWM are not in the library; they are those of the target.

The script runs the library in Simulink with given inputs (open loop), the control system being disabled in the beginning and in the middle, and compares the two enabled periods of 400 samples with *motulator* started from its initial state (MATLAB R2026a, *motulator* 0.8.1): the duty ratios differ by 4.9e-12 and the estimated speed by 6.5e-10 rad/s at most.
The build of a real-time application has not been tested.

## Model structure

- **Control system**: a masked subsystem with the S-function, with the mask parameters on tabs as in the PLECS model. A GradNet flux map is a struct in the model workspace (`est_flux_map`), whose fields the mask initialization passes to the S-function. The first output of the S-function is the duty ratios, and the others are the groups of the monitored signals, which are combined into the output `signals`.
- **Computational delay**: a Unit Delay block.
- **PWM**: a triangular carrier (Repeating Sequence, period `2*T_s`, starting from its maximum) compared with the duty ratios by a Relational Operator block. Simulink locates the switching instants by zero-crossing detection. This corresponds to `CarrierComparison` of *motulator* without the counter quantization.
- **Converter**: the ideal two-level converter with a stiff DC bus, `u_s_ab = u_dc*q_ab` (`VoltageSourceConverter`). The dead time of the converter is not modeled, but the control system of an induction machine drive can compensate for it (`PWM(d_err=...)` with `dead_time_error`), as in the PLECS export; this is intended for the control system running on the hardware. The other DC buses of the PLECS export (a capacitor or a diode bridge, `ipmsm_2kw_fvc.py --diode`) are not supported, since their switching circuits would need Simscape Electrical or the zero-crossing detection of the diode states.
- **AC filter and grid** (grid converters): the LCL filter, or the L filter with the grid inductance, modeled with space vectors in stationary coordinates in a MATLAB Function block, with the states in an Integrator block, as in `LCLFilter` and `LFilter` of *motulator*. The grid voltage `e_g*exp(1j*w_g*t)` is generated by Sine Wave blocks. Without the grid impedance, the PCC voltage measured by grid-following control is the grid voltage.
- **References and the input `enable`**: Step blocks, or a sum of Step blocks for several steps, and Constant blocks.
- **Machine**: the flux linkages as the state (an Integrator block), and a MATLAB Function block with the currents, the voltage equations, and the torque. The synchronous machine is modeled in rotor coordinates, as `SynchronousMachine` of *motulator*. The induction machine is modeled with the inverse-Γ model in stator coordinates, which is equivalent to the Γ model of `InductionMachine` of *motulator*.
- **Mechanics**: integrators for the speed and the angle (`MechanicalSystem` without friction).
- **Solver**: `ode45` (Dormand–Prince) with the relative tolerance of 1e-6 and the maximum step `T_s`, as in PLECS. The parameters of the system model are in the model workspace (`machine`, `mechanics`, and `converter`).
- **Outputs**: the root-level output ports `mdl` (the drives: `i_a`, `i_b`, `i_c`, `w_M`, `theta_M`, `tau_M`; the grid converters: the converter currents and, with the LCL filter, the grid currents) and `ctrl` (the monitored signals) for the comparison, and a scope.
- **Layout**: the blocks are aligned with the ports they connect to, so that the lines are straight, and the feedback lines are drawn through given corners.

## Agreement with *motulator*

Maximum differences (Simulink − *motulator*) printed by the comparison scripts, with *motulator* 0.8.1 and MATLAB R2026a with the MinGW-w64 compiler add-on (gcc 14.2), at the level of the PLECS models (cf. [examples/README.md](../../examples/README.md)).

The simulation of the IPMSM drive takes about 1.5 s in the normal mode (about 100 000 solver steps, mostly at the switching instants located by the zero-crossing detection) and 0.6 s in the accelerator mode, plus about 1 s of initialization.
Most of the run time of a comparison script is the start of MATLAB, the build of the model, and the compilation of the MATLAB Function block.

In `pmsyrm_6kw_gn_fvc_simulink.py`, the differences are larger, since *motulator* evaluates the GradNets in single precision, as in the PLECS model.

In addition, `tests/test_simulink.py` generates the S-functions, compiles them with gcc against a mock of the Simulink API (`tests/simulink_mock`), and runs them in closed-loop simulations of *motulator* (the drives in the sensorless and sensored modes); the results agree with those of the control systems of *motulator* to about 1e-12 relative to the signal magnitudes. The S-functions with GradNets (flux-vector control with a flux map and the machine) agree with *motulator* to its single precision.

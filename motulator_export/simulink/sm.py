"""
Export synchronous machine drives to Simulink.

This module writes a Simulink model of a motulator synchronous machine drive, in the
same way as `motulator_export.plecs.sm` writes a PLECS model. The control system is
the C-Script code of the PLECS model wrapped in an S-function, in a masked subsystem
whose parameters are the same as in the motulator API. The system model is built
from basic Simulink blocks, so no toolboxes are needed.

The model is written as a MATLAB script (and the source of the S-function), which
builds the model with `build_drive.m` of this directory. The C port uses the C99
complex type, so the S-function needs gcc (Linux), Xcode clang (macOS), or
MinGW-w64 (Windows), not MSVC.

Currently supported:

- Synchronous machine: `SynchronousMachinePars`, modeled in rotor coordinates with
  the stator flux linkage as the state, as in motulator, or
  `SpatialSaturatedSynchronousMachinePars` with a GradNet current map with spatial
  harmonics, modeled by the C-Script code of the PLECS model in an S-function
- Mechanical system (`MechanicalSystem` without friction)
- Converter: carrier comparison (`pwm=True` in `Drive`) with a stiff DC bus
  (`VoltageSourceConverter`). The carrier comparison uses the zero-crossing
  detection of Simulink. The computational delay of one sampling period is a Unit
  Delay block.
- Flux-vector control (`FluxVectorController`) with `SynchronousMachinePars` or
  `SaturatedSynchronousMachinePars` with a GradNet flux map in the sensorless or
  sensored mode, and a speed controller (`SpeedController`) in
  `VectorControlSystem`

The model can be simulated from Python via the MATLAB Engine API for Python
(`simulate`).

    Write a MATLAB script that builds the Simulink model of the drive system.

    Running the script in MATLAB compiles the S-function and saves the model (and
    the compiled S-function) in the folder of the script.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str | Path
        Path of the model (.slx). The script is written in the same folder, named
        `build_<model>.m`, with the source of the S-function.
    mdl : Drive
        Continuous-time system model.
    ctrl : VectorControlSystem
        Discrete-time control system.
    w_M_ref : StepSignal
        Speed reference (mechanical rad/s).
    tau_L : StepSignal
        External load torque (Nm).
    t_stop : float
        Simulation stop time (s).
    speed_ctrl_args : dict[str, float]
        Arguments of `SpeedController` used in `ctrl`.
    enable : StepSignal | float, optional
        Input `enable` of the control system, defaults to 1 (enabled). While it is
        not positive, the duty ratios are 0.5 and the state of the control system is
        reset to its initial value.

    Returns
    -------
    Path
        Path of the written script.
